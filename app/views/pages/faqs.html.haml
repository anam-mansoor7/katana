              We are working very hard to make the Testributor a stable and
              reliable service that will never let you down. Towards this end,
              we strive to test ourselves as many as possible platforms and
              technology combinations as we can. So far, we promise that
              Testributor can run anything that is built on:
            %ul.service-logos
              %li
                = image_tag(asset_path('service-logos/ruby.png'), width: 45)
                %span 1.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2.1
              %li
                = image_tag(asset_path('service-logos/postgres.png'), width: 50)
                %span 9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.4
              %li
                = image_tag(asset_path('service-logos/mysql.png'), width: 50)
                %span 5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.7
              %li
                = image_tag(asset_path('service-logos/redis.png'), width: 50)
                %span 2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.0
            %p.inner-text We will update this list regularly.
