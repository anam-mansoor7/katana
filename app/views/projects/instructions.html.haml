      %h3 Create any needed non tracked files

      %p
        In many projects there are files which are not tracked by the version control
        system to let developers use different versions in their machines. Still some
        of them are needed for a successfull test suite run.
      %p
        An example is the
        "config/database.yml" file in a Rails application which holds the information
        on how to connect to the database.
        You can create or override any project files
        = "#{link_to "here", project_files_path(current_project)}.".html_safe

        "testributor.yml" file is the one that describes the jobs that constitute
        each test run and for this reason it cannot be deleted.

      %h3 Create a worker on your machine

      %ol
        %li
          Install docker and docker-compose
          You can find instructions on how to do that on the
          = link_to ' official Docker site.', 'https://docs.docker.com/'
        %li
          Download the docker-compose.yml file for this project.
          = link_to docker_compose_project_path(current_project), class: "btn btn-default" do
            Download
            %i.fa.fa-download
        %li
          Create a worker by running the following command in the same directory where
          you saved the file:
          %br
          %strong docker-compose up
          %br
          For more options and documentation on docker-compose visit the official
          docker site.
