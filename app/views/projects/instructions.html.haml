    %h3 Create any needed non tracked files
  .panel-body
    %p
      In many projects there are files which are not tracked by the version control
      system to let developers use different versions in their machines.
      %br
      Still some of them are needed for a successfull test suite run.
    %p
      An example is the
      %strong "config/database.yml"
      file in a Rails application which holds the information
      on how to connect to the database.
      %br
        = "You can create or override any project files #{link_to "here", project_files_path(current_project)}.".html_safe

      %br
      %strong "testributor.yml"
      file is the one that describes the jobs that constitute
      each test run and for this reason it cannot be deleted.

      %li
        Install docker and docker-compose.
        You can find instructions on how to do that on the
        #{link_to ' official Docker site', 'https://docs.docker.com/'}.

      %li
        Download the docker-compose.yml file for this project.
        %p
          = link_to docker_compose_project_path(current_project), class: "btn btn-default" do
            Download
            %i.fa.fa-download

      %li
        Create a worker by running the following command in the same directory where
        you saved the file:
        %p
          %code docker-compose up
        For more options and documentation on docker-compose visit the
